# PROJECT

Quickly creating, scheduling and deploying recurring data pulls is a competency so common to analytics teams that the term 'data deli' exists. One regular type of data requested is the Excel Data Dump. A request of this nature will often come from a non or semi-technical business user, often savy in Excel but with minimal SQL skills. The request is usually for a large portion of a DWH table that the user can then run vlookups or sumifs on, and then aggregate however (s)he pleases. The requester normally asks to have this file emailed at a regular cadence.

This project seeks to create an easy to use repo where data professionals can schedule and publish regularly updated Excel files.
